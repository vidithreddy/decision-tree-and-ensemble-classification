# Decision Tree and Ensemble Classification (decision-tree-and-ensemble-classification)

## Purpose and Motivation
This project demonstrates applying decision tree classification (and optionally ensemble methods) to a real-world dataset. The goal is to highlight an end-to-end machine learning workflow with data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn.

## Features Demonstrated
- Data loading and inspection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pandas and seaborn
- Feature/label preparation
- Train-test split
- Decision Tree model training
- Test set evaluation with accuracy and classification report
- Clean, well-documented Jupyter Notebook

## Real-World Use Case
Decision trees and ensemble methods are widely used in applied machine learning for classification problems in healthcare, finance, marketing, and more. This project demonstrates how to approach such tasks using scikit-learn with clear, reproducible code and analysis.
